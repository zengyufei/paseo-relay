# Paseo Relay

A distributed, protocol-compatible relay for [Paseo](https://github.com/getpaseo/paseo).

Paseo Relay keeps its public WebSocket protocol independent from its deployment platform. Nodes use OTP only for discovery and route ownership. A deployment adapter reroutes WebSocket upgrades to the owning node, so frames stay inside one BEAM node.

This project is under active development and its internal protocols may change without notice.

## Protocol compatibility

`serverId` and v2 `connectionId` are accepted only up to 256 bytes. This is a
deliberate compatibility difference from the Durable Object relay, which does
not impose this relay-side route-key limit. Oversized identifiers receive `400`
before they can create ownership or session state.

## Development

The Elixir and Erlang versions are managed with [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/):

```sh
asdf install
mix deps.get
mix test
scripts/ci.sh
```

`scripts/ci.sh` is the authoritative merge gate. It runs the complete test and
release matrix, builds every Docker surface, boots the release and both relay
containers through `/health` and `/ready`, restarts the generic artifact, and
runs bounded real-WebSocket sustained, concurrent reconnect, and ownership smoke
against the generic production image.

See [LICENSE](LICENSE).

## Operations

The release has no deployment-provider dependency. Its settings are intentionally
generic:

| Setting | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `PASEO_RELAY_HOST` | `127.0.0.1` | Public listener IP. |
| `PASEO_RELAY_PORT` | `4000` | Public HTTP/WebSocket listener. |
| `PASEO_RELAY_DRAIN` | `false` | Start not-ready while existing sessions drain. |
| `PASEO_RELAY_OWNERSHIP_TARGET` | `local` | Opaque target advertised to other relay nodes. |
| `PASEO_RELAY_REROUTE_HEADER` | `x-reroute-target` | Response header used by the deployment adapter. |
| `PASEO_RELAY_CLUSTER_QUERY` | unset | Optional DNS query used to discover BEAM peers. |
| `PASEO_RELAY_MIN_CLUSTER_SIZE` | `1` | Minimum nodes required before accepting unowned sessions. |
| `PASEO_RELAY_ACCEPTORS` | `100` | Listener acceptor processes. |
| `PASEO_RELAY_CONNECTIONS_PER_ACCEPTOR` | `200` | Capacity factor multiplied by the acceptor count to set the node-local active-WebSocket ceiling; the default is 20,000. |
| `PASEO_RELAY_HTTP_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS` | `15000` | Maximum idle time for pre-upgrade HTTP parsing and unread request bodies. Upgraded WebSockets remain exempt. |
| `PASEO_RELAY_CAPACITY_MUTATION_TIMEOUT_MS` | `5000` | Maximum wait for a state-changing Capacity decision before the exact ledger epoch is invalidated. This default is provisional; certify the selected value with the staging epoch gate before rollout. |
| `PASEO_RELAY_INGRESS_BUDGET_BYTES` | `536870912` | Node-wide weighted ceiling for complete WebSocket messages admitted to relay delivery. Must admit one maximum message at the configured weight. |
| `PASEO_RELAY_INGRESS_WEIGHT` | `4` | Conservative memory weight charged per wire payload byte. |
| `PASEO_RELAY_DELIVERY_TIMEOUT_MS` | `30000` | Maximum Writer reservation/write-barrier wait before a slow destination is shed. |
| `PASEO_RELAY_TRANSPORT_SEND_TIMEOUT_MS` | `35000` | TCP send timeout. Must be greater than the Writer deadline so application shedding is recorded before the transport's final fallback. |
| `PASEO_RELAY_CONTROL_QUEUE_BYTES` | `1048576` | Per-destination bound for queued control notifications. |
| `PASEO_RELAY_DATA_ATTACH_TIMEOUT_MS` | `15000` | Maximum time a v2 client frame waits for its daemon-data socket. |
| `PASEO_RELAY_TCP_RECEIVE_BUFFER_BYTES` | `65536` | Per-socket TCP receive buffer. |
| `PASEO_RELAY_WEBSOCKET_MAX_HEAP_WORDS` | `33554432` | Per-WebSocket BEAM heap fuse, including shared binaries. Values below this protocol-safe floor are rejected. |
| `PASEO_RELAY_MEMORY_WATERMARK_BYTES` | `0` | Optional BEAM total-memory watermark that pauses admission and sheds WebSockets with `1013` until measured memory reaches the recovery threshold; disabled generically because the safe threshold depends on the deployment memory limit. |
| `RELEASE_NODE` / `RELEASE_COOKIE` | unset | Standard distributed-release identity. |

`GET /health` is a liveness probe. `GET /ready` returns `200` only while the
node accepts new work, and returns `503 {"status":"unready"}` while draining
or below the configured cluster floor, when the node-local Capacity ledger does
not answer its one-second status observation, during a memory-pressure episode,
or while the application WebSocket ceiling is full. Fly's soft limit and
temporary ingress-byte occupancy do not make the application unready. `GET
/metrics` is Prometheus text and exposes readiness, draining, active WebSockets,
active sessions, reroutes, connection rejections, delivery pressure and latency,
frame sizes, slow-consumer closes, ingress reservations, and BEAM memory for the
local node. If Capacity is unavailable, its four gauge families are omitted
rather than reported as zero.

State-changing Capacity decisions use a separate configured fail-closed
boundary. Each caller captures the current ledger PID; a timeout kills that
exact Capacity epoch, and `:rest_for_one` drains its listener and sockets before
a clean replacement admits traffic. Read-only readiness and metrics status uses
one second and never kills the ledger.

Payloads never pass through a node-wide relay mailbox. Each `serverId` Owner
stores topology metadata only, and every destination has a Writer allowing one
payload write at a time. During delivery Cowboy's native `{active, false}`
flow control suspends source reads while the WebSocket process remains available
for full-duplex writes; the source is rearmed only after the destination's
synchronous HTTP/1 send barrier. One absolute delivery deadline includes Owner
lookup, destination attachment, Writer reservation, and the send barrier;
accepted control notifications are either written within their deadline or
close the destination with retryable `1013`. Kernel TCP pressure therefore
reaches the producer without deadlocking simultaneous opposite-direction
traffic. Cowboy
may finish parsing frames already buffered before suspension, so every completed
message receives an explicit token from one node-local capacity ledger and is
queued in source order. The same ledger owns connection slots, weighted retained
bytes, delivery state, pressure order, and their gauges; a socket monitor, rather
than its termination callback, releases all tokens after abnormal death. Losing
the ledger stops the production listener and its existing connections before a
fresh ledger can reopen admission. Budget exhaustion closes that source with
retryable `1013`.

The compatible masked data-frame ceiling remains exactly 32 MiB, which permits
`32 MiB - 14 bytes` of payload. Cowboy applies that payload limit to individual
frames and reassembled fragmented messages and closes an oversized message with
`1009`. The only supported inbound v2 control message is the legacy JSON ping;
control input has a separate 64 KiB Cowboy ceiling and is charged to the same
ledger through parsing. Outbound control notifications use the same Writer
boundary with their own bounded byte queue. Cowboy assembles a complete payload
before the application can request its byte-only Capacity token, and incomplete
fragment assembly remains inside the connection process. The 32 MiB ceiling,
per-WebSocket heap fuse, and configured node memory watermark limit and shed
this staging risk; they do not provide a strict pre-parser memory reservation.
Generic operators should set a nonzero watermark from their runtime limit;
blocked deliveries are shed first.

See [`OPERATIONS.md`](OPERATIONS.md) for the production failure model,
capacity policy, and alerting signals.

Build a production release with `MIX_ENV=prod asdf exec mix release`, build a
generic container with `docker build -t paseo-relay .`, or use the
[standalone deployment](deployment/standalone/README.md) for self-extracting
Linux, Windows, and macOS executables that require no installed BEAM toolchain.
The explicit provider adapter in [`deployment/fly`](deployment/fly) translates
its platform node input into `RELEASE_NODE`; nothing under `lib/` or `scripts/`
depends on it.

Cluster ownership uses [Syn](https://hexdocs.pm/syn/readme.html), an eventually
consistent distributed process registry. A network partition can temporarily
admit one owner for the same `serverId` on each side. When the registry
converges, Syn keeps one owner and the losing owner's WebSockets close with
`1012`, causing clients to reconnect through normal routing. Existing
WebSockets have no transparent migration or cross-partition forwarding. Restore
or fence a prolonged partition before treating reconnects as one session again;
see [`OPERATIONS.md`](OPERATIONS.md) for the operational consequence.

## Black-box load testing

The executable client uses actual WebSockets and the deployed v2 query contract:
`serverId`, `role`, optional `connectionId`, and `v=2`. It opens matching
server-data and client roles, so it can measure bidirectional traffic without
importing relay code. It prints one JSON object containing connection success and
failure counts, requested pairs and WebSockets, setup and steady durations, frame
throughput, p50/p95/p99 latency, duration, cleanup timeouts, client RSS/CPU,
and optional relay RSS/CPU (`--relay-pid`).

Safe local smoke test:

```sh
node scripts/relay-load.mjs --scenario idle --pairs 10 --duration 10
node scripts/relay-load.mjs --scenario sustained --pairs 10 --rate 10 --duration 10
node scripts/relay-load.mjs --scenario ownership --servers 1000 --batch-size 200 --duration 1
```

CI deliberately keeps this boundary bounded: 25 paired sockets under sustained
traffic, 25 pairs across two reconnect waves, and 200 distinct ownership
claims. That catches protocol, concurrency, cleanup, and reconnect regressions;
it is not evidence for the current roughly 23,000-WebSocket production fleet.

The generic load client deliberately has no provider fault or certification
mode. Fly's short manual procedure starts three ordinary sustained-load
processes through exact-Machine proxies and owns only Fly-specific fault and
cleanup commands. See [deployment/fly/README.md](deployment/fly/README.md) for
the fixed 23,001-WebSocket command, operator inputs, and numeric pass criteria.
The target shard establishes its sockets without publishing, then starts its
data/control publisher only after Capacity suspension acknowledges; the two
unaffected shards publish continuously.
The documented contract uses `PASEO_FLY_EXPECTED_CONNECTION_CEILING`, requires
all old target sockets to drain, and then runs a full same-`serverId`
replacement shard inside the configured timeout tolerance. That destructive
staging-only gate requires a persistent `PASEO_FLY_ARTIFACT_DIR` and has not
been run for this change. Its short `summary.json` indexes retained raw traffic,
diagnostic, ownership, timing, cleanup, and memory-peak evidence rather than
copying those producer schemas.

Distributed ownership and reroute decisions are exercised with real local BEAM
peer nodes in the test suite:

```sh
mix test test/paseo_relay/router_integration_test.exs test/paseo_relay_test.exs
PASEO_OWNERSHIP_SURGE_COUNT=50000 mix test test/paseo_relay_test.exs
```

A multi-node data test must run behind a deployment adapter capable of replaying
the original WebSocket upgrade. The Fly adapter uses `fly-replay`; all load
clients still use one public endpoint and the proxy performs node placement.

Capacity tests need an appropriate file-descriptor limit and kernel socket
budget. The ownership scenario opens one real daemon-control WebSocket for each
distinct `serverId`; it measures ownership churn rather than many clients on one
daemon. Other high-load diagnostic commands, deliberately not rollout gates:

```sh
ulimit -n 120000
node scripts/relay-load.mjs --scenario ownership --servers 15000 --batch-size 500 --duration 30 --relay-pid "$RELAY_PID"
node scripts/relay-load.mjs --scenario idle --pairs 25000 --batch-size 250 --ramp-ms 100 --duration 300 --relay-pid "$RELAY_PID"
node scripts/relay-load.mjs --scenario sustained --pairs 1000 --batch-size 250 --ramp-ms 100 --rate 5 --duration 300 --relay-pid "$RELAY_PID"
node scripts/relay-load.mjs --scenario reconnect --pairs 1000 --batch-size 250 --ramp-ms 100 --reconnects 20 --duration 10
```

The sustained example sends in both directions: 1,000 pairs × 5 ticks/s × 2
frames = 10,000 frames/s. The 50,000-socket command is a stress target for a
node configured with a higher ceiling and enough memory, not the production
default. `--batch-size` bounds concurrent opens; `--ramp-ms` spaces each
batch. `--duration` measures steady traffic only, while JSON reports setup and
steady durations separately. Teardown waits up to 15 seconds for clean close
handshakes by default; use `--cleanup-grace` to tune that bound. A close that
does not finish within the bound is reported as `cleanup_timeouts` and still
makes the run fail. Abnormal closes remain connection failures.

To distribute a run across load generators, open the daemon control socket on
one generator and pass `--no-control` to the others. Give every generator a
different `--connection-prefix`; they can then share one `--server-id` without
connection ID collisions, exercising a single relay owner through reroutes.
Use `--keepalive` when a load scenario should include application-level
heartbeat traffic. The relay itself does not impose an idle WebSocket timeout.

A disposable load-generator image is available without any deployment-provider
assumptions:

```sh
docker build -f deployment/load/Dockerfile -t paseo-relay-load .
```
